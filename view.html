                    <p>Here's a step-by-step recipe for making classic pasta carbonara: <br>

                        Ingredients: <br>
                        
                        Spaghetti: 400 grams (or another long pasta like linguine or bucatini) <br>
                        
                        Pancetta or guanciale: 150 grams, cut into small cubes <br>
                        
                        Eggs: 4 large (use 3 whole eggs and 1 yolk) <br>
                        
                        Parmesan cheese: 100 grams, grated (or Pecorino Romano for a more traditional touch) <br>
                        
                        Garlic: 1 clove, optional <br>
                        
                        Black pepper: Freshly ground <br>
                        
                        Salt: For the pasta water <br>
                        
                        
                        Step-by-Step Instructions: <br>
                        
                        1. Boil the Pasta: <br>
                        
                        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente according to the package instructions. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining. <br>
                        
                        
                        
                        2. Prepare the Sauce Mixture: <br>
                        
                        In a mixing bowl, combine the grated Parmesan cheese with the eggs. Beat until smooth and set aside. <br>
                        
                        
                        
                        3. Cook the Pancetta or Guanciale: <br>
                        
                        In a large skillet or frying pan, cook the pancetta or guanciale over medium heat. If desired, add a clove of crushed garlic for extra flavor and remove it once it becomes golden. <br>
                        
                        Cook until the meat is crispy and the fat has rendered out. Remove from heat to prevent it from burning. <br>
                        
                        
                        
                        4. Combine Pasta and Pancetta: <br>
                        
                        Add the drained spaghetti directly to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss until well-coated in the rendered fat. <br>
                        
                        
                        
                        5. Add the Egg Mixture: <br>
                        
                        Remove the skillet from the heat (to prevent scrambling the eggs) and pour in the egg and cheese mixture. Quickly toss the pasta, adding a bit of reserved pasta water as needed to create a creamy sauce. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs gently. <br>
                        
                        
                        
                        6. Season and Serve: <br>
                        
                        Add plenty of freshly ground black pepper and toss again. Taste and adjust with more cheese or pepper if desired. <br>
                        
                        Serve immediately, garnished with additional grated Parmesan and black pepper. <br>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        Enjoy your delicious homemade pasta carbonara!</p>

                    1 cup rava (semolina)
                    
                    1/4 cup rice flour

                    1/4 tsp black pepper
                    
                    1-2 green chilies, chopped
                    
                    1 tbsp grated ginger
                    
                    1/4 cup finely chopped onions
                    
                    A pinch of asafoetida (hing)
                    
                    Salt to taste
                    
                    Water (for batter)
                    
                    Oil or ghee (for cooking)
                    
                    
                    Instructions:
                    
                    1. Prepare the batter: In a bowl, mix rava, rice flour, all-purpose flour (optional), cumin seeds, black pepper, chopped chilies, ginger, onions, and salt. Add enough water to make a thin batter (like buttermilk consistency).
                    
                    
                    2. Rest the batter: Let the batter rest for 15-20 minutes.
                    
                    
                    3. Heat the pan: Heat a non-stick or cast iron pan on medium-high and grease lightly with oil or ghee.
                    
                    
                    4. Make dosa: Pour a ladle of batter onto the hot pan. Spread it thin and unevenly in a circular motion (it should be lacy).
                    
                    
                    5. Cook: Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges. Cook until the edges turn crispy and the top looks set (2-3 minutes).
                    
                    
                    6. Flip and cook (optional): If desired, flip the dosa and cook for another 30 seconds.
                    
                    
                     <br>
